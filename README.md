# **Overview of the analysis**

---------------------------------

-  As two young business professionals return from a trip from NYC to De Moines, Iowa they reflect on their trip.  They come up with a idea to start their own bike ride sharing in De Moines but they have to convice investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.  The young professionals go out and get the trip data from the citi-bike website and create visualizations to verfiy the viability of the business.

# **Summary**

---------------------------------

- The business professional did excellent work demonstrating the viability of Citi-Bike in NYC.  Although in business there is a lot to be said about correlation and causation.  There are a lot of correlation that can be made in respect to NYC.  Although because it works in NYC does that mean it will work in Des Moines, Iowa.  Citi-Bike plays on the numbers that NYC has to offer with over 8 million people living in a condensed area.  Also according to an April 2021 tourism study by the Office of the New York State Comptroller, a 10-year period of record growth in tourism came to an end in 2020, when the number of visitors fell by 67% to 22.3 million from 66.6 million in 2019.  The plays into the viability of the NYC success.  According to new research by Longwoods International, commissioned by Catch Des Moines, the Greater Des Moines region welcomed 13.7 million visitors in 2016, representing a new record for Iowaâ€™s capital city.  
-   With the huge upswing in tourist activity, there are a lot of correlations to demographics, geographics, start times, and  durations Des Moines, Iowa only has approximately 215K population with a booming tourism.  So as an investor this is something to look at.  

- Additional visualizations that i would like to see is how densly pack the stations are in a specific area.  This would require zip code or district information.  We can use our location information and cross reference that with our.
- I would also like to get an understanding of how many car owners there are in NYC because of the limited space so many people are without a car. In Des Moines, Iowa  there are only having 215K people and a lot more open space.  
      - With the majority of the riders in NYC being subscribers and using the citi bike and an mean of transporation to get to and from work, I would just question how much of this business would be dependent on tourism in Des Moines.

# **Overview of the analysis**

---------------------------------

-  As two young business professionals return from a trip NYC back De Moines, Iowa they reflect on their trip.  They come up with a idea to start their own bike ride sharing in De Moines but they have to convice investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.  The young professionals go out and get the trip data from the citi-bike website and create visualizations to verfiy the viability of the business.

# **Summary**

---------------------------------

- The business professional did excellent work demonstrating the viability of Citi-Bike in NYC.  Although in business there is a lot to be said about correlation and causation.  There are a lot of correlation that can be made in respect to NYC.  Although because it works in NYC does that mean it will work in Des Moines, Iowa prolly not.  Citi-Bike plays on the numbers that NYC has to offer with over 8 million people living in a condensed area.  Although there are a lot of correlations to demographics, geographics, start times, durations, but Des Moines, Iowa only has approximately 215K population with zero tourism.  So as an investor this is possibly the worst idea ever.  

- Additional visualizations that i would like to see is how densly pack the stations are in a specific area.  This would require zip code or district information.  We can use our location information and cross reference that with our.
- I would also like to get an understanding of how many car owners there are in NYC because of the limited space many people are without a car and with Des Moines, Iowa only having 215K people there is not a on space.
